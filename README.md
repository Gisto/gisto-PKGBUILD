gisto-PKGBUILD
==============

AUR package for ArchLinux

> All packages need to include .AURINFO 

The easiest way to generate AUR package from PKGBUILD is `mkaurball`

### Generation of AUR package:

Clone: https://github.com/falconindy/pkgbuild-introspection to the same directory with PKGBUILD

Run `cd gisto-PKGBUILD && sh ./mk` - this will take care of the package building
